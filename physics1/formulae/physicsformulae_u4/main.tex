\section*{Newton's Laws}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item A body remains at rest, or in motion at a constant speed in a straight line, unless acted upon by a force. (Things don't move on their own, bodies are lazy)
		\item When a body is acted upon by a force, the time rate of change of its momentum equals the force. ($F=ma$)
		\item If two bodies exert forces on each other, these forces have the same magnitude but opposite directions. (If I push a thing that won't budge, it pushes back at me with the same magnitude, but opposite direction)
	\end{enumerate}
\section*{Gravity and Normal Forces}
	The force of gravity is given as $F=mg$. $g=9.82$ in Sweden.

	Normal forces are always perpendicular to the ground. On a level plane at rest this is equal to the force of gravity. These are \emph{not} counter forces according to Newton's 3rd law, since they act only on one object, not two separate  ones.
