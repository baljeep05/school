	\section{Spermatogenesis}
		\emph{Spermatogenesis} is the process through which sperm are made. The \emph{seminiferous tubules} are located in the testes, and are where \emph{meiosis} occurs. \emph{Spermatozoa}, also known as sperm, are created here, before maturing in the epididymis.
		
		\subsection{Hormones in Sperm Production}
			The same hormones that are involved in the menstrual cycle in females are involved in sperm production. Namely, FSH and LH. Testosterone is secreted by the testis.
